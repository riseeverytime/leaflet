## React prerequisites

This documentation assumes you are already familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and have a project setup. If it is not the case, you should read [React's Getting Started documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) first.

## Leaflet prerequisites

This documentation assumes you are already familiar with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). React Leaflet **does not replace Leaflet**, it only provides bindings between React and Leaflet.

This documentation **is not a replacement** for [Leaflet's documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html), it only focuses on aspects specific to React Leaflet.

:::caution Read this before going further
Before using React Leaflet, you must setup your project following [Leaflet's Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/).

## Adding React Leaflet

:::caution Alpha version
React Leaflet v4 is currently in alpha and will only officially support React v18, even if it works with React v17.

### Using ESM imports

React Leaflet export [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that can be imported by URL, notably from CDNs such as [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/):

```js
import { MapContainer } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react-leaflet@next/MapContainer.js'
import { TileLayer } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react-leaflet@next/TileLayer.js'
import { useMap } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react-leaflet@next/hooks.js'
```

Or importing the full library at once:

```js
import {
  MapContainer,
  TileLayer,
  useMap,
} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react-leaflet@next/index.js'
```

### Using a package registry

A package registry such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) can be used to install React Leaflet and its dependencies.

React, React DOM and Leaflet are required peer dependencies. You must add them to your project if they are not already installed:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install react@^18.0.0-rc react-dom@^18.0.0-rc leaflet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add react@^18.0.0-rc react-dom@^18.0.0-rc leaflet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then you can install React Leaflet:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install react-leaflet@next
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add react-leaflet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Modules can then be imported using bare specifiers when supported by a bundler such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```js
import { MapContainer } from 'react-leaflet/MapContainer'
import { TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet/TileLayer'
import { useMap } from 'react-leaflet/hooks'
```

Alternatively, all the components and hooks can be imported from the module entry-point:

```js
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, useMap } from 'react-leaflet'
```

## TypeScript support

React Leaflet provides TypeScript definitions in the installed packages, but needs Leaflet's definitions to be present. If you have not installed them yet, you will need to add them:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install -D @types/leaflet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add -D @types/leaflet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
