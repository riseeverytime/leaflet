## React prerequisites

This documentation assumes you are already familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and have a project setup. If it is not the case, you should read [React's Getting Started documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) first.

## Leaflet prerequisites

This documentation assumes you are already familiar with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). React Leaflet **does not replace Leaflet**, it only provides bindings between React and Leaflet.

This documentation **is not a replacement** for [Leaflet's documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html), it only focuses on aspects specific to React Leaflet.

:::caution Read this before going further
Before using React Leaflet, you must setup your project following [Leaflet's Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/).

## Adding React Leaflet

React, React DOM and Leaflet are required peer dependencies. You must add them to your project if they are not already installed:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install react@17 react-dom@17 leaflet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add react@17 react-dom@17 leaflet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that React Leaflet v3 only supports React v17, **v18 is not supported**.

Then you can install React Leaflet:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install react-leaflet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add react-leaflet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, you can import the necessary components. For example:

```js
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup } from 'react-leaflet'
```

## Using TypeScript

React Leaflet provides TypeScript definitions in the installed packages, but needs Leaflet's definitions to be present. If you have not installed them yet, you will need to add them:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install -D @types/leaflet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add -D @types/leaflet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
